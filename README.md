This repository is a local playground for LeetCode exercises.



We implement basic data structure used in LeetCode like tree, ListNode and provide basic printing methods for debug.



For example:

1. Tree:

> [tag]------- run -------
> [tag]>
>   1
>   /\   
>  0  2 
> [tag]case[0] passed
> [tag]>
>      1
>    /   \      
>   0     0    
>    \        
>     3      
> [tag]case[1] passed
> [tag]>
>           4
>       /                    
>      0                    
>        \                 
>         0               
>         \             
>          0           
> [tag]case[2] passed
>
> Process finished with exit code 0



For programming languages, we support Java and Kotlin for practices.
